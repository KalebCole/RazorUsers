- When you run your website you will notice everything seems to work but none of your changes persist from page to page.
    - Why do you think that is?
    -     Every time we rerender the page, the constructor is called again, which has all of the data, so it is refreshed.
    - What change do you think we could make to solve the problem?
    -     Guess 1: If we move the data into a more persistent location like a database or even a json file and fetch data from it, it will solve the problem.
    -     Guess 2 (after seeing the answer): Additionally, we can change the scope of the dependency injection to only call the constructor at the start.
    - Why do you think it works after making the change?
    -     It works because the program does not call the constructor every rerender of the page. It only calls the constructor at the start, so the "new" keyword is not being invoked.
